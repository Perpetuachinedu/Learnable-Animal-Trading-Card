            <p id="info">The homing pigeon, also called the mail pigeon or messenger pigeon, is a variety of domestic pigeons derived from the wild rock dove, selectively bred for its ability to find its way home over extremely long distances. In recent times, the homing pigeon has been used in the IT company to carry a data packed 4 GB memory stick agaisnt the ADSL service provider, Telcom, over a distance of 80km (50miles). With this pigeon, the data transfer took 2hrs, 6mins, and 57 sec - the same amount of time it took to transfer 4% of the data over the ADSL. </p>
